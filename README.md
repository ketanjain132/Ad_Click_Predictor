# Ad Click Prediction

## Overview

Ad Click Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at creating a predictive model for forecasting ad click-through rates (CTR). The project optimizes ad targeting by recommending target users based on predicted CTRs, resulting in more efficient and cost-effective ad campaigns.

## Project Details

- **Logistic Regression Model:** The project utilizes logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to create a predictive model for ad click prediction.

- **Enhanced Campaigns:** By predicting CTRs, the project enhances ad campaigns by targeting users more effectively, leading to improved campaign efficiency.

- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project empowers businesses to make data-informed decisions, increasing user engagement and optimizing ad spending.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Python's machine learning libraries are used to implement the predictive model.
